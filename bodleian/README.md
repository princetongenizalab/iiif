# IIIF manifests for Bodleian Genizah Fragments 

This repository contains static [IIIF](http://iiif.io) manifests 
generated from [Genizah Fragments at the Bodleian Libraries](http://genizah.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/)
by the [Center for Digital Humanities at Princeton](http://cdh.princeton.edu) and the [Princeton Geniza Lab](https://genizalab.princeton.edu/), for use in the [Princeton Geniza Project](https://geniza.princeton.edu/).

Images are available for non-commercial use; see the [Terms of Use](https://genizah.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/terms) for more details.

## Technical details

Content was generated by [python scripts in the Princeton Geniza Project codebase](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/geniza/tree/main/scripts#iiif) based on Bodleian Libraries images and XML available online at https://github.com/bodleian/genizah-mss

The copyright statement and logo in these manifests were adapted from existing Digital Bodleian content.

The `manifests_to_csv.py` script was used to generate `pgp-bodleian-manifests.csv`, which can be used for batch import into the PGP application.
