## Technical details

Manifests were generated by [python scripts in the Princeton Geniza Project codebase](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/geniza/tree/main/scripts#iiif) based on the Manchester IIIF content available online at 

A full set of JRL manifests was collected by harvesting URLs and shelfmarks ("reference numbers") from the IIIF Collection for this content using the script `jrl_crawl_iiif.py`.

The resulting CSV was used as input to `jrl_iiif.py`, which aggregated manifests based on shelfmark, and then generated new manifests with canvases from the original manifests, in sequence.

The copyright statement is based on access and images rights from the original records.

The `manifests_to_csv.py` script was used to generate `pgp-jrl-manifests.csv`, which can be used for batch import into the PGP application.

An official Manchester logo was downloaded, added to this site, and included in manifests, to replace the "Luna" platform logo in their existing manifests, so that source of the content would be recognizable and easier to credit on the PGP site.
